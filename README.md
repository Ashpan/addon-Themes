# FRC Dashboard Themes
This addon adds a select box to choose the theme of your dashboard. You can choose from several premade themes or add your own.

## Installation
1. Copy the contents of `themes.html` to where the comments above the portions of the document say they should go.
2. Copy the contents of the folder `css` to the already-existing directory of the same name.
3. Copy the sections of `themes.js` to where the comments above each section say they should go.
4. You're done! You are invited to modify the CSS of these themes or add your own. If you change or create something you think could benefit others, feel free to open a pull request on this repository.
